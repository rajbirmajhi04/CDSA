/*
    ! Pass by value: 
    * Simple but copies the array. Inefficient for large arrays
    * Changes made to the array inside the function won't affect the original array

    ! Pass by reference:
    * Efficient and allows modifications of the original arrays
    * No copying is involved

    ! Pass by const reference:
    * Efficient and ensures the original array won't be modified
    * No copying is involved

    ! Pass by pointers:
    * Efficient and allows modification but requires careful handling (Manual handling)
    * No copying is involved

/*
    ! Methods:
    ? Element Access:
    * []: Access the element at the specified position without bounds
    * at(): Access the element at the specified position with bounds checking
    * get(): Access the element at the specified position (Member of tuple)
    * front(): Returns reference to the first element
    * back(): Returns reference to the last element
    * data(): Returns pointer underlying array
     
    ? Capacity:
    * size(): Returns the number of elements in the array
    * max_size(): Returns the maximum number of elements the array can hold
    * empty(): Checks whether the array is empty
    
    ? Modifiers:
    * fill(): Assign the given value to all the elements
    * swap(): Swaps the content of two array
    * copy(): Copies content of one array into another array
    * move(): Move one array's content into another

    ! Introduction:
    * Array classes are generally more efficient, light-weight and reliable than C-style arrays.
    * With C-style array there is more risk of array being decayed into a pointer. Array classes donâ€™t   decay into pointers.
    * The size is fixed at compile time and cannot be changed. 
     
    ! Difference between C-Style and STL Arrays:
    * In C-Style arrays the uninitialized elements default to garbage values
    * In STL arrays default to zeroes
    
    * In C-Style arrays size must be manually tracked
    * In STL arrays size can be retrived using memebr function
    
    * In C-Style no bound checking is performed
    * In STL arrays bound checking is performed using member functions
    
    * Cannot be copied or assigned directly
    * Can be copied and assigned directly using member function
    
    * Not compatible with most standard library algorithms and containers
    * Fully compatible
    
    * Simple and minimal overhead but offers no automatic memory management features
    * Typically has a slight overhead due to its additional functionalities but still efficient and offers better safety and usability features
