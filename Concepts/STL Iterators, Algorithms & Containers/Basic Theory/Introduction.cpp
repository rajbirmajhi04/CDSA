/*
* In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides a set of programming tools to implement algorithms and data structures

* Containers: The STL provides a range of containers, such as vector, list, map, set, and stack, which can be used to store and manipulate data.

* Algorithms: The STL provides a range of algorithms, such as sort, find, and binary_search, which can be used to manipulate data stored in containers.

* Iterators: Iterators are objects that provide a way to traverse the elements of a container. The STL provides a range of iterators, such as forward_iterator, bidirectional_iterator, and random_access_iterator

* Function Objects: Function objects, also known as functors, are objects that can be used as function arguments to algorithms. They provide a way to pass a function to an algorithm, allowing you to customize its behavior

* Adapters: Adapters are components that modify the behavior of other components in the STL. For example, the reverse_iterator adapter can be used to reverse the order of elements in a container.

/*
! Sequence Containers: Sequence containers implement data structures that can be accessed sequentially
* array, vector, deque, forward_list and list

! Associative Containers: Implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched O(log n)
* set, map, multiset, multimap

! Unordered Containers: Implements unsorted (hashed) ds that can be quickly searched O(1) and O(n) best and worst case
* unordered_set, unordered_map, unordered_multiset, unordered_multimap

! Container Adapters: Provides different interface for sequential containers
* stack, queue, priority_queue
