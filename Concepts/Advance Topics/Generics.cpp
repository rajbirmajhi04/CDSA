    * The method of Generic Programming is implemented to increase the efficiency of the code. Generic Programming enables the programmer to write a general algorithm which will work with all data types. It eliminates the need to create different algorithms if the data type is an integer, string or a character.

    * The advantages of Generic Programming are:
    ? Code Reusability
    ? Avoid Function Overloading
    ? Once written it can be used for multiple times and cases.

    * Function and Class template
