Data structures are organized ways to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently, depending on the type of operations you need to perform. They provide a means to organize large amounts of data for optimal performance in various algorithms and tasks.

Common Data Structures:

1) Arrays:
--> Array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of same type in contiguous memory locations
--> Fixed size, Indexed Access, Contiguous Memory, Homogeneous Elements and Linear

--> Advantages: Memory Efficient and Fast Access
--> Disadvantages: Fixed Size, Insertion and Deletion requires shifting of elements
